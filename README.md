Welcome to the **DBMS SQL Scripts** repository! This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for both **Oracle** and **MySQL** databases. The aim is to enhance understanding of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and assist in interview preparation.

## Repository Overview

This repository will be continually updated with various SQL scripts, including but not limited to:

- **Oracle SQL Scripts**: PL/SQL scripts covering a wide range of topics from basic queries to advanced database management tasks.

- **MySQL Scripts**: SQL scripts tailored for MySQL databases, focusing on practical applications and optimization techniques.
